# Objective:
The group project serves as an evaluation of students' acquisition of knowledge and software skills related to web and mobile application development. This project will require students to collaborate in teams to design and implement a web or mobile application, showcasing their ability to apply the learned concepts in a real-world context.

# Group Details:
- Group Size: 2-3 students per group.
- Mobile Application Requirement: For groups with 3 students, a mobile application is also required in addition to the web application.
# Project Guidelines:

1. Application Design and Implementation:

    - Each group will design and implement a web application based on their chosen topic.
    - The application should demonstrate proficiency in implementing all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on at least two collections of data.
    - The relationship between the collections should be established.
    - Token-based authentication must be implemented to ensure secure access to the application.
2. Collaboration:

    -  Each group must collaborate effectively and distribute responsibilities among team members.
3. Demonstration:

    - At the end of the project, each group will demo their web and/or mobile application during class.
4. Evaluation:

    - The projects will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
        - Proficiency in implementing CRUD operations on at least two collections, with the use of lookup functionality.
        - Successful implementation of token-based authentication.
        - Design and usability of the application.
        - Collaboration and project management within the group.
        - Ability to demonstrate the application's functionality.
        - Extra features such as role-based authentication, data visualizations and the use of pre-trained AI models.
